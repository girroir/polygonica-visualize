# polygonica-visualize
Sample c++ class mapping HOOPS Visualize meshes to polygonica solids and back. Several basic Polygonica functions are wrapped implemented and return Visualize meshes.

## Todo:
* Remove dependancies on other classes and create a stand-alone bridge class
* Create a sample project that initializes HOOPS Visualize and Polygonica and uses the bridge class
